# Worksheet Automation

ws_automation is a Python app that automatically updates data of multiple Excel workbooks. In this example, the application will be targeting a number of financial reports and generating a new column of data that signifies the commission earned on each sale. Additionally, a bar chart will also automatically be added to each sales report based on the commission earnings of each sale.

## Getting Started
